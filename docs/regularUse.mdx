The regular work cycle in a fully managed Rojo project generally involves the following steps:

1. Save the place file
2. Unpack the place file into different models
3. Build or serve the place file with Rojo
4. Repeat

With Rostar, this process is the same, but is much simpler to execute.

## Extracting instances from a place

To extract models and/or scripts from a place file, the following command is used:

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl
```

or to extract from a place id:

```bash
rostar unpack 12345678
```

:::note
If unable to extract from a place id, Remodel might not be able to authenticate properly. In some cases, a `REMODEL_AUTH` environment variable might need to be set. For example (on Linux and MacOS):

```bash
export REMODEL_AUTH="<Insert Roblox cookie>"; rostar unpack <Place id>
```

[See more info on Remodel's repository.](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel#Authentication)
:::

By default, the unpack command generates a folder structure that tries to replicate the structure of the Roblox DataModel. ModuleScripts, LocalScripts, and Scripts are placed in `.lua` files (wherever possible), and other instances are placed in rbxm or rbxmx files.

```

DataModel/
ServerScriptService/
Code/
init.server.lua
someModule.lua
ReplicatedStorage/
Shared/
someModule.lua
ServerStorage/
someModule.lua
Workspace.rbxm
Lighting.rbxm
SoundService.rbxm
...

```

:::tip
By using `--assets-directory <Folder name>` as an argument to the command, scripts and model files can be in separate directories.
:::

### Extracting models only

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl --no-lua
```

If Rostar is only used for extracting models, `--no-overwrite-project` should be used as well for preserving the existing script paths. Edits to the project file might be needed if new directories are added. More on this in the [Rojo-first workflow](<../Workflow guides/rojoFirst>) article.

### Extracting scripts only

```bash
rostar unpack ./Path_To_Place_File.rbxl --no-models
```

## Building the place file

The place file can be generated by running:

```bash
rostar pack OutputPlaceFile.rbxl
```

:::tip

`rostar pack` can be run by itself if a file named after the `name` property from the project file should be outputted.

:::

This is virtually equivalent to running:

```bash
rojo build --output OutputPlaceFile.rbxl
```

## Tips

To run a command every time your place file changes, the [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) utility package can be used. After installing it with `npm i -g nodemon`, it can be set up so unpacking runs every time the place file changes:

```sh
nodemon -w StudioPlace.rbxl --exec rostar unpack StudioPlace.rbxl
```
